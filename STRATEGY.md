# Jeweling — Brand Strategy & Roadmap

*Last updated: February 22, 2026*

---

## Brand Essence

**One-liner:** The definitive destination for jewelry lovers — where craft meets culture.

**Positioning:** Aspirational in quality, not exclusivity. Contemporary and culturally plugged-in. Opens the door rather than guards it.

**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Passionate without pretension. Like a knowledgeable friend who geeks out over a perfectly executed pavé setting.

**Inspiration:** If Chef's Table, Highsnobiety, and a great independent jeweler had a beautiful, well-funded baby.

## Content Pillars

| Pillar | Description | Example Stories |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Craft** | The art and technique behind the work | Atelier visits, maker profiles, how it's made |
| **Culture** | Jewelry's role in fashion, music, film, art | Red carpet deep-dives, hip-hop jewelry history, costume design |
| **Commerce** | Smart buying, collecting, investing | Buying guides, auction previews, market trends |
| **Community** | The people who love this world | Collector profiles, designer interviews, industry voices |

## Content Mix

- **80% jewelry-focused** (core identity)
- **20% adjacent luxury** (watches, fashion, art, travel — always with a jewelry lens)

### What We Cover
✅ Fine jewelry & high jewelry
✅ Independent/emerging designers  
✅ Watches (natural crossover)
✅ Fashion + jewelry intersection
✅ Art & design crossovers
✅ Auction & vintage market
✅ Cultural moments (red carpet, music, film)
✅ Travel (jewelry destinations, atelier tours)

### What We Don't Cover
❌ Generic luxury lifestyle without jewelry angle
❌ Fast fashion / costume jewelry (unless culturally significant)
❌ Pure product catalog / shopping content (we're editorial first)
